# Conversational-Interface
An interaction interface to perform tasks using natural language conversations.

## Abstract

This is an experimental flutter application that uses **ML** and **NLP** to perform interactive tasks with a conversational interface. The goal is to achieve a clean minimal design which is capable enough to understand user's inputs and perform desired tasks. The interface also provides suggestions (preferably with help of machine learning) for the users to interact more efficiently.

## Design

In progress.
